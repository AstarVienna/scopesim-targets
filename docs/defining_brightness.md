# Defining target brightness

## Nomenclature
The name _brightness_ was chosen as the least ambigous of several rejected alternatives and because it matched with the ESO standard.
It is not usually associated with any particular unit or physical type, but rather more of a general "how bright is my source".

### Rejected alternatives
Some of these were used in ``ScopeSim_Templates``, with no particular standard.

#### Magnitude
Physical flux units can also be used to specify brightness.
Calling it _magnitude_ would suggest it only accepts magnitudes.

#### Flux
The opposite as with _magnitude_, this would suggest using a magnitude value is _not_ supported.

#### Amplitude
This name seems more fitting for the scaling of normalized profiles, can be confusing for point sources.

#### Luminosity
The second-best alternative, but still more associated with specific units, like $L_\odot$.

## Possible way to specify brightness
TBA.
